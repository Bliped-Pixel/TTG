# TTG
•	A java application created by a team of three, in which we took forth the task of eliminating the manual work of assigning periods every semester.
•	We formulated a Dynamic algorithm that allocates periods precisely without any clashes between classes.

The project is done in java, it's not a web application.
This project is specifically hand tailored to staisfy the needs of our college, and cannot be implemented for every use.


The logic.java file contains the main algorithm
The input.java file gets input from user using a excel sheet
And the rest of the files included contribute to the User Interface
The program, dependencies are attached as jarfiles1 and jarfiles2
