# TTG
•	A java application created by a team of three, in which we took forth the task of eliminating the manual work of assigning periods every semester.
•	We formulated a Dynamic algorithm that allocates periods precisely without any clashes between classes.

The project is done in java, it's not a web application.
This project is specifically hand tailored to staisfy the needs of our college, and cannot be implemented for every use.
